# UEA-Map

The idea of this projet is to generate a way to visualize all the mandatory and optional courses (UEA) for the Physics engineering bachelorÂ´s degree. All the data: course name, requirements; is obtained from the document "Plan_I_Fisica" provided by the university.

The .csv files were written manually and the UEAmap.pdf map was generated using Gephi (0.9.2), the main goal of this project is the create a Python code that reads the original document and automatically exports data to a .csv file and generates a visualization.
